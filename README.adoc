= The LOTUS Initiative

As the shorter READMEs are the best, we decided to give detailed documentation in our https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/wiki[Wiki].

*LOTUS*, actually, represents the most exhaustive resource of documented structure-organism pairs.
Within the frame of current computational approaches in Natural Produtsâ€™s research and related fields, 
these documented structure-organism pairs should allow a more complete understanding of organisms and their chemistry.
