== Miscellaneous

=== Minimal working example
A minimal working example containing XXX entries coming from various DB's is proposed.
Use this example to check if all steps are running correctly on your machine.

=== Molconvert issue
At the moment, we use molconvert (commercial) for structure to chemical name conversion. Since we cannot disseminate it, you won't be able to proceed to the translation except if you modify following variables in src/paths.R accordingly:

[source,console]
----
works_locally_only <- TRUE // FALSE
molconvertPath <- adapt_path_to // "~/../../Applications/MarvinSuite/bin/molconvert"
----

=== To build the flowchart
[source,console]
----
yarn global add @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

mmdc -i flowchart.mmd -o flowchart.svg
----

=== To build a graph from the make
(
  Requires remake and gprof2dot <https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot>
)

[source,console]
----
remake --profile -B curating
gprof2dot -f callgrind callgrind.out.50802 | dot -Tpng -o output_full.png
