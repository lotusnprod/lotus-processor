=== Molconvert issue
At the moment, we use molconvert (commercial) for structure to chemical name conversion. Since we cannot disseminate it, you won't be able to proceed to the translation except if you modify following variables in src/paths.R accordingly:

[source,console]
----
works_locally_only <- TRUE // FALSE
molconvertPath <- adapt_path_to // "~/../../Applications/MarvinSuite/bin/molconvert"
----

=== To build the flowchart
[source,console]
----
yarn global add @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

mmdc -i docs/flowchart.mmd -o img/flowchart.svg
----

See https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli for more info
