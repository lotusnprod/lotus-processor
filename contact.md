Dear XX,

We have as research project the objective to build an open database compiling natural products chemical structures, their producing organisms and an associated bibliographic reference documenting this link. For this we have compiled over 30 publically and commercially available databases and standardized the chemical and the biological organisms entries. We have also added for each entriy its corresponding taxonomy (at the chemical and biological level).
In order to host such database Wikidata appeared to us as the perfect solution.
Our initial idea was to create a dedicated WikiProject page (could you tell us if this is mandatory/necessary in our case) and then link entries for the

1.  WikiProject Chemistry (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Category:WikiProject_Chemistry>)
2.  WikiProject Taxonomy (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Taxonomy>)
3.  WikiProject_Source_MetaData (<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Source_MetaData/Bibliographic_metadata_for_scholarly_articles_in_Wikidata>)

We thus decided to contact you as maintainers/active contributors of one of the above WikiProjects in order to check wether our idea was feasible.
If it is the case could you give us

- first directions on how we could contribute to data addtion to your respective project
- given the attached minimal entry example inform us wether you would require additional info or if the fields are sufficient
