Dear XX,

We have as research project the objective to build an open database compiling natural products chemical structures, their producing organisms and an associated bibliographic reference documenting this link. For this we have compiled over 30 publically and commercially available databases and standardized the chemical and the biological organisms entries. We have also added for each entriy its corresponding taxonomy (at the chemical and biological level).
In order to host such database Wikidata appeared to us as the perfect solution. 
Our initial idea was to create a dedicated WikiProject page (could you tell us if this is mandatory/necessary in our case) and then link entries for the WikiProject Chemistry - WikiProject Taxonomy - WikiProject Bibliographic references
