# The LOTUS Initiative

*LOTUS*, actually, represents the most exhaustive resource of documented structure-organism pairs.
Within the frame of current computational approaches in Natural Produtsâ€™s research and related fields, 
these documented structure-organism pairs should allow a more complete understanding of organisms and their chemistry.

As the shorter READMEs are the best, we decided to give detailed documentation in our [Wiki](https://github.com/lotusnprod/lotus-processor/wiki).

## tl;dr

If you are in a hurry and don't want to go through the whole documentation, what you need is:

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda run -n lotus_env bash environment_non_conda.sh
conda run -n lotus_env MODE=min make curating
```
